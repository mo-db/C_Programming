Hacking on PostgreSQL is really hard. I think a lot of people would agree with this statement, not all for the same reasons. Some might point to the character of discourse on the mailing list, others to the shortage of patch reviewers, and others still to the difficulty of getting the attention of a committer, or of feeling like a hostage to some committer's whimsy. All of these are problems, but today I want to focus on the purely technical aspect of the problem: the extreme difficulty of writing reasonably correct patches.

There are tons of examples that I could use to demonstrate this, but it would be unfair to embarrass anyone else, so I'll take an example drawn from my own very recent experience: incremental backup. I consider this a moderately complex feature. It was an ambitious project, but there are certainly much more ambitious things that somebody might want to do, and that some people have done. This project has actually been brewing for several years; an earlier incarnation of the project morphed into the effort to create pg_verifybackup. In 2023, I worked back around to the main event again. I spent several months having on incremental backup in the first half of the year, and then several more months on it in the last quarter, ending with a commit of the feature on December 20, 2023.
